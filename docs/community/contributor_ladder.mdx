## Contributor Ladder

Hello! We are excited that you want to learn more about our project contributor ladder! 
This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the project, 
along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with them. 
Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up it as their involvement in the project grows.
Our project members are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into three sections. 
"Responsibilities" are tasks that a contributor is expected to do. 
"Requirements" are qualifications a person needs to meet to be in that role, 
and "Privileges" are rights contributors on that level are entitled to.

### Contributor
A Contributor directly adds value to the project. 
Contributions need not be code. 
Individuals at the Contributor level may be new contributors, 
or they may only contribute occasionally.

* Responsibilities include:
    * Follow the [CNCF CoC](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
    * Follow the project [contributing guide](./contributing_guide.mdx)
    * Participation in community Slack channel(s)
* Requirements (one or several of the below):
    * Report and sometimes resolve issues
    * Occasionally submit PRs
    * Contribute to the documentation
    * Attend project meetings, take notes
    * Answer questions from other community members
    * Submit feedback on issues and PRs
    * Test releases and patches and submit reviews
    * Run or helps run events
    * Promote the project in public
    * Help run the project infrastructure
* Privileges:
    * Invitations to contributor events
    * Eligible to become an Organization Member

### Owners Structure
There are two types of owners in the ORAS project hierarchy: organization owners and subproject owners.
ORAS organization owners oversee the overall project and its health. 
Subproject owners focus on a single repository, 
a group of related repositories, 
a service (e.g., a website), 
or subproject to support the other subprojects (e.g., marketing or community management).

Changes in ORAS Organization owners have to be announced via an 
[issue on the Community repository](https://github.com/oras-project/community/issues). 
Changes to sub-project owners are to be announced via the appropriate sub-project issue.

### Owner Responsibility
ORAS owners adhere to the requirements and responsibilities set forth in the respective ORAS Organization Owners and Subproject Owners. 
They further pledge the following:

* To act in the best interest of the project and subprojects.
* To ensure that project and subproject development and direction is a function of the needs of the community.
* To take action when reasonably confident that it is the right action to take.
* To fulfill the responsibilities outlined in this document and its dependents.

### ORAS Organization Owners
The ORAS Organization owners are responsible for:

* Maintaining the mission, vision, values, and scope of the project.
* Refining the governance and charter as needed.
* Making project level decisions.
* Resolving escalated project decisions when the subproject owners responsible are blocked.
* Managing the ORAS brand.
* Controlling access to ORAS assets, such as source repositories, hosting, project calendars.
* Deciding what subprojects are part of the ORAS project.
* Deciding on the creation of new subprojects.
* Overseeing the resolution and disclosure of security issues.
* Managing financial decisions related to the project.

Changes to org owners abide by the following:

* Any subproject owner is eligible for a position as an org owner.
* No one company or organization can employ a simple majority of the org owners.
* An org owner may step down by submitting an issue stating their intent and they will be moved to emeritus.
* Org owners MUST remain active on the project. 
If they are unresponsive for > 6 months, 
they will lose org ownership unless a super-majority of the other org owners agrees to extend the period to be greater than 6 months.
* When there is an opening for a new org owner, 
any current owners may nominate a suitable subproject owners as a replacement
    * Nominations for new owners must be made by creating an issue.
* When nominated individual(s) agrees to be a candidate for ownership, 
the subproject owners may vote
    * The voting period will be open for a minimum of three business days and 
    will remain open until a super-majority of project owners has voted.
    * Only current org owners are eligible to vote via casting a single vote each via a +1 comment on the nomination issue.
    * Once a super-majority has been reached the owner elect must complete onboarding prior to becoming an official ORAS owner.
    * Once the owner onboarding has been completed, a pull request is made on the repo adding the new owner to the OWNERS file.
* When an org owner steps down, they become an emeritus owner.

Once an org owner is elected, 
they remain a owner until stepping down (or, in rare cases, are removed). 
Voting for new owners occurs when necessary to fill vacancies. 
Any existing subproject owner is eligible to become an org owner.

The Org Owners will select a chair to set agendas and call meetings of the Org Owners. 
Chairs will serve a term of 6 months, 
once the term is complete org owners will select a subsequent chair.

### Subproject Owners
Subproject owners are responsible for activities surrounding the development and release of content 
(eg. code, specifications, documentation) or the tasks needed to execute their subproject 
(e.g., community management) within the designated repository, 
or repositories associated with the subproject (e.g., community management). 
Technical decisions for code resides with the subproject owners unless there is a decision related to cross 
owners groups that cannot be resolved by those groups. 
Those cases can be escalated to the org owners.

Subproject owners many be responsible for one or many repositories.

Subproject owners do not need to be software developers. 
No explicit role is placed upon them and they can be anyone appropriate for the work being produced. 
For example, if a repository is for documentation it would be appropriate for owners to be technical writers.

Changes to owners use the following:

* A subproject owner may step down by submitting an issue stating their intent and they will be moved to emeritus.
* Owners MUST remain active. 
If they are unresponsive for > 6 months, they will be automatically removed unless a super-majority of the other subproject owners 
agrees to extend the period to be greater than 6 months.
* New owners can be added to a subproject by a super-majority vote of the existing owners.
* When a subproject has no owners, the ORAS org owners become responsible for it and may archive the subproject or find new owners

## Onboarding a New Owner
New ORAS owners participate in an onboarding period during which they fulfill all code review and issue management responsibilities 
that are required for their role. 
The length of this onboarding period is variable, 
and is considered complete once both the existing owners and 
the candidate owners are comfortable with the candidate's competency in the responsibilities of ownership. 
This process MUST be completed prior to the candidate being named an official ORAS owner.

The onboarding period is intended to ensure that the to-be-appointed owner is able/willing to take on the time requirements, 
familiar with ORAS core logic and concepts, understands the overall system architecture and interactions that comprise it, 
and is able to work well with both the existing owners and the community.

## Inactivity
It is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. 
Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, 
contributor attrition, and a lost of trust in the project.

* Inactivity is measured by:
    * Periods of no contributions for longer than 6 months.
    * Periods of no communication for longer than 6 months.
* Consequences of being inactive include:
    * Involuntary removal or demotion.
    * Being asked to move to Emeritus status.

## Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met. 
This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, extended period of inactivity, 
a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, 
and/or a violation of the Code of Conduct. 
This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opens up opportunities for new 
contributors to step in.

Involuntary removal or demotion is handled through a vote by a majority of the current Maintainers.

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process
If and when contributors' commitment levels change, 
contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status 
(completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, 
or reducing your contributor level.
